ClinicR
=======

I am the sole developer of this project as of today and this is my first venture developing an end to end web-application. ClinicR is intended as a basic application for managing patient info at a doctor's clinic.

As of 10-June 2013 this is still WIP and I expect to have this working completely in a few weeks.Although, I really work at my own pace on this project. Once I am done, I intend to publish more comprehensive documentation on how to use and configure this application.

Some notes about the technologies and code:
- ClinicR is written in ruby & javascript/jquery and uses the Sinatra dsl, Redis as it's datastore and uses Oauth2 to authenticate from Google.
- Almost everything in the application is configurable and can be tuned to how you would like to see it.
- I have learnt all of these from various people on the internet who have contributed to the community for free. 
- The code for ClinicR can serve as a reference for someone trying to develop a similar application.


As of today, the code is available free "as it is" for any purpose. I offer no warranties or any other commitments for the code or this project in any possible way. However if you have any comments on the code or are looking for any particular feature, I am happy to listen. If you feel like collaborating with me on this project, please feel free to send me an email.
