ClinicR
=======

This is my first venture developing an end to end web-application & I am the sole developer of this project as of today and. ClinicR is intended as a basic application for managing patient info at a doctor's clinic.

Here is a [link](http://li584-132.members.linode.com:9292/) to the demo url.

TBD more comprehensive documentation on how to use and configure this application.

Some notes about the technologies and code. Clinic
- ClinicR is written in ruby & javascript/jquery and uses Sinatra, Redis as it's datastore and uses Oauth2 to authenticate from Google. 
- The idea has been to keep almost everything in the application configurable.
- Contributions from various people on the Internet have been utilized while developing this project and is acknowledged. TBD: list of references.

The code is available free "as it is" for any purpose. I offer no warranties or any other commitments for the code or this project in any possible way. However if you have any comments on the code or are looking for any particular feature, I am happy to listen.
