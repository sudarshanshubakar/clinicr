ClinicR
=======

This is my first venture developing an end to end web-application. 

ClinicR is written in ruby and uses the Sinatra dsl, Redis as it's datastore and uses Oauth2 to authenticate from Google.

The code is available free "as is" for any purpose. I offer no warranties for the code in any possible way. However if you have any comments on the code or are looking for any particular feature, I am more than willing to give you a patient ear :-).
